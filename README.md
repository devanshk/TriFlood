# TriFlood
Experiment to design an algorithm that solves Kami2 puzzles

Process:
1. Build Kami2 game environment [60% done]
2. Build Kami2 game visualizer
3. Program A* based algorithm to find a 'path' of moves that leads to a solved board
4. Measure performance on prohibitively large puzzles against brute force
